# groovy-examples

The following are some examples I have put together as needed for Groovy 

AwsVmMd2Json.groovy - This example reads the metadata on an AWS VM instance and dumps it in JSON

json2map.groovy - This example reads a JSON structure, converts in into a multi-dimensional map and then looks for a key
