# groovy-examples

The following are some examples I have put together as needed for Groovy.

The following table describes the examples and what they do

>| File | Description | 
>| ----- | ----------- |
>| `AwsVmMd2Json.groovy` | This example reads the metadata on an AWS VM instance and dumps it in JSON. Also supports GCP using  http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/ |
>| `json2map.groovy` | This example reads a JSON structure, converts in into a multi-dimensional map and then looks for a key using a recursive map lookup |
>| `runshell.groovy` | This example runs various commands using process manager API |
